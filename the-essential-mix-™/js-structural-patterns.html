      /* Flyweight - reduces teh cost of creating and manipulating a 
         large number of similar objects.
      */
      
      /* Decorator - dynamically adds or overrides behavior in an
         existing method of an object (see Inheritance in any OOP)
      */
      
      /* Adapter - match interfaces of different classes therefore
         classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces.
         (see Java interfaces)
      */
      
      /* Chain of responsibility - a way of passing a request be-
	 tween a chain of objects to find the object that can handle
	 the request.
      */
      
      /* Bridge - separates an objects interface from its implentation
         so the two can vary independently.
      */
      
      /* Proxy - provides a placeholder for another object to control
         access to it, reduce cost and complexity.
      */
      
      /* Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem 
         and provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in
         this system. (see bad PHP programming habits...)
      */
      
      /* Composite - composes zero or more similar objects so that
         they can be manipulated as one object.
