      /* Mediator - define an object that encapsulates how a set of 
	 objects interact.
      */
      
      /* Iterator - Accesses the elements of an object sequentially
	 without exposing its underlying representation.
      */
      
      /* Interpreter - A way to include language elements in an
	 application to match teh grammar of the intended language.
      */
      
      /* Chain of responsibility - a way of passing a request be-
	 tween a chain of objects to find the object that can handle
	 the request.
      */
      
      /* Command - creates objects which encapsulate actions and params.
      */
      
      /* Observer - a way of notifying change to a number of classes
	 to ensure consistency between them.
      */
      
      /* Strategy - define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
	 and make them interchangeable.
      */
      
      /* Template - define the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract
	 class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
      */
      
      /* Visitor - adds a new operation to a class without changing
	 the class.
      */
      
      /* State - allows an object to alter its behavior when its inter-
	 nal state changes. (see React.js)
      */
      
      /* Memento - capture an object's internal state to be able to
	 restore it later. (see PHP's serialize/unserialize sessions)
